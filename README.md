# MultiSpeedSlider
Subclass to UISlider with variable scrubbing speed, heavily influenced by https://github.com/ole/OBSlider

* Installation
You can install MultiSpeedSlider using Cocoapods, but maybe I have done somthing wrong with the podspec file you have have to speecify the path to the project on github in your podfile using:
pod 'MultiSpeedSlider', :git => 'https://github.com/Sajjon/MultiSpeedSlider.git'

Which will make it work.
