# MultiSpeedSlider
Subclass to UISlider with variable scrubbing speed, heavily influenced by [OBSlider](https://github.com/ole/OBSlider)

# Installation
You can install MultiSpeedSlider using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), but maybe I have done somthing wrong with the podspec file you have have to speecify the path to the project on github in your podfile using:

```ruby
pod 'MultiSpeedSlider', :git => 'https://github.com/Sajjon/MultiSpeedSlider.git'
```

Which will make it work.
